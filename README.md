This repo contains simulation scripts that were used to generate results in the paper: "Fundamental limits on patterning by Turing-like reaction-diffusion mechanisms" by Daniel Muzatko, Bijoy Daga, and Tom Hiscock. 

For intuitive, easy-to-use scripts that apply for many different types of reaction-diffusion system, check out: https://github.com/hiscocklab/ReactionDiffusion.jl!
