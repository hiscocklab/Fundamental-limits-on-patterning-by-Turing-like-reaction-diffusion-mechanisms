This repo contains simulation scripts that were used to generate results in the paper: "Fundamental limits on patterning by Turing-like reaction-diffusion mechanisms" by Daniel Muzatko, Bijoy Daga, and Tom Hiscock. 

If you're interested in simulating reaction-diffusion models in your own research, we've made an easy-to-use and documented pipeline; check out: https://github.com/hiscocklab/ReactionDiffusion.jl!
